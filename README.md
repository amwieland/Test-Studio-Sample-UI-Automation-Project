# Test-Studio-Sample-UI-Automation-Project
Sample tests built on Sitefinity Quantum site

These files contain the .tstest and resx files correlating to the Telerik Test Studio product tests.
You can sync Test Studio to this project and contribute, or even clone for yourself.
Please let us know any test examples that you may want to see added to this.

For test maintenance and execution you will only need Test Studio and the .tstest file.
The .resx file contains the storybook/expected state images, but is not required for execution.

If the test has 1 or more coded steps then there will also be a corresponding .cs or .vb
This file will need to stay with the corresponding .tstest file.

Happy Testing!
